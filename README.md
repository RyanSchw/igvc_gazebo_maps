## How to install

* Remove your `igvc_gazebo` directory (move it to another directory if you have changes you don't want to lose)
* Add the submodule: `git submodule add https://github.com/RyanSchw/igvc_gazebo_maps igvc_gazebo`
  * This clones the repository to a new igvc_gazebo folder. *You must leave the folder name as igvc_gazebo for the paths to work. If this is not the naming convention you follow, let me know.*
* Commit and push your changes (it should be `.gitmodules` and `igvc_gazebo`
